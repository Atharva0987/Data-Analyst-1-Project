## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates **data cleaning and preprocessing** using **Python (Pandas & NumPy)**.  
The dataset (`sample_employee_data.csv`) contains employee details with missing values, duplicates, outliers, and invalid entries.  
The goal is to clean the dataset and generate a **ready-to-use cleaned dataset** (`cleaned_sample_employee_data.csv`).

- Handles missing values (fills with **mean** or **median**).  
- Removes duplicates.  
- Replaces infinite values with NaN and drops them.  
- Detects and removes outliers using the **3-sigma rule**.  
- Saves the cleaned dataset as `cleaned_sample_employee_data.csv`.
